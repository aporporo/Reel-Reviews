# Reel Review. A Film Review Web Data Application.

This project allows the user to search for any movie, be presented with all the relevant information for that movie, and be presented with reviews!

## Description

The requirements for this project were to utilize the OMDb API and the Google Gemini API to create a website that will allow users to search for a movie, be presented with all the revelant data, have reviews generated by Gemini, and to track user ratings in a database. Users are able to register an account and login, this will allow them to leave a rating.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you would like to play around with it, happy to share a link!
